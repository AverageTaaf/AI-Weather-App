## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code formatting

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const fetchWeatherData = async (location) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}?q=${location}`);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching weather:', error);
        throw error;
    }
};

// Avoid
function getWeather(loc) {
    fetch(url + loc).then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log(d));
}
```

### CSS Style Guide

- Use CSS variables for colors and common values
- Follow BEM naming convention where applicable
- Keep selectors specific but not overly complex
- Group related properties together

**Example:**
```css
/* Good */
.weather-card {
    background-color: var(--card-bg);
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 25px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px var(--shadow-color);
}

.weather-card__title {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    color: var(--primary-color);
}

/* Avoid */
.card {
    background: white;
    padding: 25px;
}
```

### HTML Style Guide

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep nesting levels reasonable
- Use meaningful class names

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Good -->
<section class="weather-section" aria-label="Current Weather">
    <h2 id="weather-heading">Current Weather</h2>
    <article class="weather-card">
        <!-- Content -->
    </article>
</section>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div class="section">
    <div class="heading">Current Weather</div>
    <div class="card">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Use proper Markdown formatting
