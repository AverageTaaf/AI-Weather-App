**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### In Issues

Hi! I found a bug where the map doesn't load on Safari. Here are the steps to reproduce:
1. Open the app in Safari 17
2. Search for a city
3. The map section shows a loading spinner indefinitely

I checked the console and see this error: [error message]

Would you like me to investigate further or submit a PR?
```

❌ **Bad**:
```
Your app is broken! The map doesn't work. Fix it now!
```

### In Pull Requests

✅ **Good**:
```
This PR adds dark mode support. I've tested it on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Changes:
- Added CSS variables for theme colors
- Implemented theme toggle button
- Persisted theme preference in localStorage

Let me know if you'd like any changes!
```

❌ **Bad**:
```
Added dark mode. Merge it.
```

### In Code Reviews

✅ **Good**:
```
Thanks for the contribution! The functionality looks great. I have a few suggestions:

1. Could we add error handling for the API call on line 45?
2. Consider extracting the validation logic into a separate function for reusability

What do you think?
```

```
This code is terrible. Rewrite it.
```
